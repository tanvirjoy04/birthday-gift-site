# birthday gift site
Project aimed for Advanced Students learning Frontend Development.
- I've always wanted to build something (an app or, website) to surprise my friends with a sudden birthday present.

First hands-on-built birthday gift site in my life. 🎉, 👏, 🎊, 🎈

Congratulations to me.


## Feature I want to add (later on)
- Surprise my best friend on birthday at exact midnight 12AM.
- Auto send this gift at exact time. (12am of Birthday)
